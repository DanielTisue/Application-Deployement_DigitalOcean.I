# Create an ssh key
In this section we will create an ssh key.

-On a mac: 
* open finder
<p align="left" >
<img alt="Open finder" width="200" src="ScreenFindTerminal1.png">
</p>

* go to applications

<p align="left" >
<img alt="Select Applications" width="600" src="ScreenFindTerminal2.png">
</p>

* open the utilities folder
* click on terminal
<p align="left" >
<img alt="Under the uitlity folder open terminal" width="600" src="ScreenFindTerminal3.png">
</p>

...or...

* hit <kbd>command &#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>space bar</kbd> to open spotlight search
* type in "terminal"

<p align="left" >
<img alt="Spotlight shortcut" width="600" src="Terminal-Spotlight_shortcut.png">
</p>

.... and Wa-Lah!
