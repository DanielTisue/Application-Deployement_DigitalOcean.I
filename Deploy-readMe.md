# Application Deployment - Digital Ocean
This is an introduction into the first steps of deploying a production worthy NodeJs, Express, EJS, MongoDB application to Digital Ocean.

### Preface
Digital Ocean is a paid platform starting from about 5$ monthly*. This platform gives the developer a wide range of customization options. I've personally searched far and wide to find options that will best suit usage and budget. The conclusion I came to is, currently, there isn't an effective or efficient way to host a site as a professional product without paying something. Specifically, I needed to host this site as a finished product meaning it has to have an <b>SSL certificate</b>, be <b>hosted</b>, and have a <b>custom domain name</b>. This was what I found to be the best option after countless hours of video watching and other research.  Please be aware, however, that there are other methods depending on the type of site as well as other options that best suit you or you're clients needs.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.
