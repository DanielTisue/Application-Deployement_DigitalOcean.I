## Step 2
In your terminal write this:

``
ssh-keygen
``

This should genrate an ssh key and the output should look like this:

``
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/your_home/.ssh/id_rsa):

``

If you already have an ssh key installed then your output should look something like this:

``
/home/your_home/.ssh/id_rsa already exists.
